## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a Computer Science student who has found his passion in software Development, I'm currently looking for internships.

## Appendix

The purpose of this project is to create my personal portfolio where my projects and information about me are displayed to get a taste of what I enjoy doing the most.

On the other hand this project served to improve my skills to deploy code on the server side.  The hardest thing about this project was to know how everything works from the back. 

I practiced deployments in Microsoft Azure, however for price I had to transfer it to Heroku, however, it is a tool that has nothing to ask the other since the resources that this project uses are more than enough.
